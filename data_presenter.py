#Loop through all the data and print out the total for each invoice (Note: this data is not provided by the csv, you will need to calculate it. Also, keep in mind the data from the csv comes back as a string, you will need to convert it to a float. Research how to do this.).

#Close your open file.

#Explore the graphing tools covered in todayâ€™s lecture. See if you can implement one of them to display the total income of chocolate cupcakes vs vanilla cupcakes vs strawberry cupcakes.
